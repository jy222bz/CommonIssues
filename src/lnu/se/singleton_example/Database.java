/**
 * This is a singleton class.
 * Singleton is good in some instances but not always because
 * it does not allow flexibility.
 * <p>
 * It is good when you do not want to create multiple instances of an object.
 * In this example, it is a database, and that is understandable since a program may have
 * one database, therefore, it does not make any sense to create many instances of the database and
 * it is good to make one instance and protect the information.
 * <p>
 * It is also good for UTIL classes when they do not hold values rather they provide
 * functionaries, and these functionaries often do not change over time.
