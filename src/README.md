# Common Issues!

Sometimes we code and apply bad practices without even knowing it. Bad practices will cause issues that will make it difficult to solve some assignments
in some particular courses that require clean code.
____ 
Here are a few tips for applying and adapting acceptable practices:

 1. Use the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. It is a commercial tool, but with your student ID, you can get a free license. It has analysis tools that can be used to inspect the code. Furthermore,
 It provides suggestions when it realizes the code has issues. 
 This is an excellent opportunity.
 
 2. Install the Sonarlint plug-in in your IDE. It will pinpoint the code's issues and explain why they have been flagged as issues. It can provide solution suggestions as well.
 Sonarlint encourages acceptable practices and clean code. 
 
 3. Fix the issues that your IDE or Linter finds in your code. DO NOT just ignore them.
 There is no point in installing linters in the first place if the issues will be ignored. Try to
 understand why they have been flagged as issues.
 
 4. As a developer, you should always strive for a clean, controllable, and testable code and optimized solutions.
 
 5. If there is any issue or anything that has not been covered in this code, please feel free to contact me and will
 try to update the materials accordingly to address the new issues in any way I can.
 
 ### There are common issues that are applied frequently. Also, a few concepts in programming get misunderstood often. In this code, I have addressed some of these questions with examples.
 ### Please, check the code. We all here to learn from one another. I hope it will be of use to you!
